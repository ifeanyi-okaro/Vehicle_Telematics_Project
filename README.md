# Vehicle_Telematics_Project

This repository contains my vehicle telematics project.

The code can be run by structuring the folder like this repository with the data files placed in a folder name 'data' which should be in the same folder with the python notebook.
If the file is placed in another folder, the full path to the file has to be specified in the import section of the notebook.

The notebook can be run without changes. If the library import of seaborn or datetime fails, please install them with the codes provided at in[2] section of the notebook. 

If there are more questions please contact me for details.
